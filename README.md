This project presents a deep learning-based time series forecasting system designed to predict stock prices using historical data. It focuses on Walmart Inc. (WMT) stock and leverages multiple machine learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bidirectional LSTM, and Bayesian Ridge Regression. The workflow includes fetching historical stock prices via the yfinance API, preprocessing the data with normalization and sequence creation, and training various models to learn temporal patterns. Each model is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MSE, MAE, and RÂ² score. Comparative analysis is performed to visualize and assess model performance, and the system includes mechanisms to check for overfitting. Additionally, the project makes real-time predictions for the latest closing price based on the most recent data. This end-to-end pipeline demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in financial forecasting and provides a framework for model comparison and real-world deployment in stock price prediction tasks.
